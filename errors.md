Errors

## Exceptions

All the errors generated by Alchemic are related to incorrect usage. For example, trying to set a factory method to be an external reference to an instance, or trying to inject multiple objects into a single variable. Because these are to be caught and dealt with by the developer, Alchemic throws them as instances of `ALCException`, which extends `NSException`. 

This is in line with [Apple's recommendations](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Exceptions/Exceptions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000012i) which indicate that exceptions should be used for programming errors and `NSError` references used for data errors. 


## Circular dependency detection

It's possible with dependencies to get into a situation where the dependencies of one object reference a second object which needs the first to resolve. In other words, a chicken and egg situation. 

Alchemic attempts to detect these endless loops of dependencies when it starts up by checking through the references that have been created by the macros and looking for loop backs. If it detects one it will immediately throw a `ALCCircularReferenceException` exception.
