Alchemic is a [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) (DI) framework for iOS. It's goal is to help you manage object creation, object properties and variables. And it should be as simple and easy to do this as possible.

Please take a look at the [main documentation site](http://drekka.github.io/Alchemic) for details on installing and configuring Alchemic.
