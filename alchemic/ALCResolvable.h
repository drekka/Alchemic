 When resolving and this is YES, will use a fresh stack for circular dependency detection.

 @discussion Circular dependency detection is about detecting circular dependencies which alll need to resolve at the same time. For example, arguments to methods. When resolving, each resolvable adds itself to the dependencyStack before calling it's dependencies to resolve. So by checking the stack we can establish if there is a loop. But some resolveables such as injected variables are not required immediately because they are injected later, so in effect they break the dependency stack.
