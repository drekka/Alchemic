 When resolving and this is YES, will use a fresh stack for circular dependency

 @discussion Circular dependency detection is about detecting circular
 dependencies which alll need to resolve at the same time. For example,
 arguments to methods. When resolving, each resolvable adds itself to the
 dependencyStack before calling it's dependencies to resolve. So by checking the
 stack we can establish if there is a loop. But some resolveables such as
 injected variables are not required immediately because they are injected
 later, so in effect they break the dependency stack.
