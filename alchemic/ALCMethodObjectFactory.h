/**
 A factory that creates objects by calling methods on a class.

 Methods can be either class methods or instance methods. If instance methods then the parent class will be instantiated as necessary so that the methods can be called.

 Unlike variable injections, methods must have all of their arguments fully created and completed before injection. This is done because we cannot tell what the code within the method will do, and therefore do not know what it might need from the arguments.
